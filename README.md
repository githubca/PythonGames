2048-python
===========
forked from https://github.com/yangshun/2048-python

Based on the popular game [2048](https://github.com/gabrielecirulli/2048) by Gabriele Cirulli. The game's objective is to slide numbered tiles on a grid to combine them to create a tile with the number 2048. Here is a Python version that uses TKinter!

Enhancement:
    1, bind arrow key (left,right,up,down) event for easy operation;
    2, add more comments for logic, cover_up is actually move left;
    3, change grid to 5 for more fun, change font so it fit the screen size;

To start the game, run:
    
    $ python3 puzzle.py
